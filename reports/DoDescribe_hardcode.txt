DoDescribe Method - Hardcode Implementation Report
=================================================

Implementation Status: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
All tests passing: 15/15 tests passed (6 for DoDescribe, 9 for existing methods)

Overview
--------
Successfully implemented the DoDescribe method for the iCustomConnector2 interface following the project's established patterns and guidelines. The implementation includes:

1. Handler.cs - Main method orchestrator with comprehensive unit tests
2. Hardcode.cs - Static hardcoded response based on the provided JSON example 
3. Integration with the global test suite

Files Created
-------------
- /iCustomConnector2impl/Methods/DoDescribe/Handler.cs
- /iCustomConnector2impl/Methods/DoDescribe/Hardcode.cs
- Updated /iCustomConnector2impl/Program.cs to include DoDescribe tests in global test run

What Was the Hardest Part
-------------------------
The hardest part was understanding the comprehensive nature of the DiscoveryInfo class with its many properties (90+ properties) and ensuring that all boolean defaults and string values were set correctly to match the JSON example. The DiscoveryInfo class has a complex structure with multiple types of configuration parameters (string params, boolean params, choice params) and it was important to get all the defaults right.

Ambiguities and Confusions Encountered
---------------------------------------
1. **Test Integration**: Initially unclear how the global test suite worked - discovered that Program.cs needed manual updates to include new method tests rather than automatic discovery.

2. **Property Mapping**: Some properties in the provided hardcode example didn't have direct matches in the interface definition (like "PrasswordDesc" which appears to be a typo for "PasswordDesc" in the JSON), but the interface had the correct spelling.

3. **Error Handling**: DiscoveryInfo doesn't have built-in error fields like other return types, so error handling had to be more creative (setting error message in ConnectorTitle).

4. **Namespace Structure**: Had to understand the specific namespace pattern: AiGeneratedConnector.Methods.{MethodName}.{Handler|Hardcode}

Recommendations for Improving Documentation and Project Design
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Automated Test Discovery**: Implement reflection-based test discovery in Program.cs so that new method implementations are automatically included in the global test run without manual code changes.

2. **Interface Documentation**: Add XML documentation comments to the DiscoveryInfo class properties to explain what each property controls and when it should be true/false.

3. **Hardcode Template Generator**: Create a script that can generate the basic Hardcode.cs file structure from the interface definition, pre-populating all properties with sensible defaults.

4. **Property Validation**: Add a validation method to DiscoveryInfo that checks for common mistakes (empty required strings, conflicting boolean settings).

5. **JSON Schema Validation**: Provide a JSON schema for the expected DoDescribe response to validate the hardcode implementation against the actual SOAP response format.

Specific Suggestions for Future Developers
------------------------------------------

1. **Copy the Provided Hardcode**: Always start with the provided *-hardcode.cs file in doc/per-interface-method/ as it contains realistic values. Don't try to invent your own values.

2. **Test Boolean Defaults**: Create separate test methods for boolean properties that should be false vs true, as boolean logic errors are easy to make and hard to spot.

3. **String Property Testing**: Test that string properties contain expected substrings rather than exact matches when the content might vary (like URLs or version numbers).

4. **Pattern Consistency**: Follow the exact namespace and class structure of existing implementations - the pattern is very consistent and deviation will break the test framework.

5. **Error Handling Strategy**: Since DiscoveryInfo lacks error fields, consider what happens when the hardcode method fails - the current approach of putting error info in ConnectorTitle works but isn't ideal.

6. **Test Coverage**: Include tests for edge cases even in hardcode mode - null parameter handling, exception catching, etc.

Overall Experience
------------------
The implementation was straightforward once the patterns were understood. The project has good structure and consistency. The main challenge was the breadth of configuration options in DiscoveryInfo rather than any architectural complexity. The testing framework worked well and provided good feedback.

The documentation provided (JSON examples, request/response docs, existing hardcode implementation) was comprehensive and made the implementation much easier than it would have been otherwise.

Total Implementation Time: Approximately 45 minutes
Difficulty Level: Medium (due to DiscoveryInfo complexity, not architectural issues)
