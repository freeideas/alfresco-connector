DoGetAvailableDatastores Hardcode Implementation Report
=======================================================

Implementation Date: 2025-08-13
Task: Implement hardcoded/mock version of DoGetAvailableDatastores method
Phase: Hardcode-only (no external services)

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
======================

Successfully implemented the DoGetAvailableDatastores method with:
- Hardcode.cs: Returns static mock data based on provided examples
- Handler.cs: Main method implementation with comprehensive unit tests
- All unit tests passing (6 total: 4 in Handler, 2 in Hardcode)

FILES CREATED
=============

1. /iCustomConnector2impl/Methods/DoGetAvailableDatastores/Hardcode.cs
   - Static method returning DataStoreInfoReturn with 4 sample datastores
   - Matches the structure from DoGetAvailableDatastores.json example
   - Includes 2 unit tests

2. /iCustomConnector2impl/Methods/DoGetAvailableDatastores/Handler.cs
   - Main method that delegates to Hardcode.cs
   - Exception handling with proper error responses
   - Includes 4 comprehensive unit tests covering various scenarios

3. Updated Program.cs to include DoGetAvailableDatastores tests in test runner

HARDEST PARTS OF IMPLEMENTATION
===============================

1. Understanding the Interface Complexity:
   The DoGetAvailableDatastores method has many parameters (7 total), but in the 
   hardcode phase, most of these (filters, templateService, loadTemplates) don't 
   affect the output. This required careful reading of the documentation to understand
   that hardcode implementations should return static data regardless of input.

2. DataStoreInfo Model Mismatch:
   The actual SOAP response contains additional fields (templateid, templatedesc, 
   defaultviewname, defaultviewid, alert, MBFlagValue) that are not in the 
   DataStoreInfo model. However, since this is hardcode-only phase, I focused on 
   implementing the interface as defined rather than trying to match the SOAP exactly.

3. Test Coverage Strategy:
   Determining the right balance of test coverage was challenging. I implemented tests for:
   - Normal operation with valid inputs
   - Null parameter handling (important for robustness)
   - Filter parameter variations (to verify hardcode behavior)
   - Exception handling (to ensure errors are properly caught)

AMBIGUITIES AND CONFUSIONS
==========================

1. Model vs SOAP Response Mismatch:
   The DataStoreInfo class in ICustomConnectorInterfaces.cs doesn't include all fields
   shown in the SOAP response example (e.g., MBFlagValue, templateid). This suggests
   the interface was simplified or the SOAP response includes legacy fields.

2. Filter Parameter Behavior:
   The method signature includes filter1, filter2, filter3 parameters, but there's no
   clear documentation on how these should affect the hardcode response. I assumed
   they should be ignored in hardcode mode.

3. loadTemplates Parameter Usage:
   The loadTemplates boolean parameter isn't clearly documented in terms of how it
   should affect the response in hardcode mode. I implemented it to be ignored.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
===============================

1. Documentation Improvements:
   - Add clear examples showing how filter parameters should affect responses
   - Document the relationship between DataStoreInfo model and actual SOAP response
   - Clarify which parameters are ignored in hardcode mode vs external mode

2. Model Consistency:
   - Consider adding missing fields to DataStoreInfo model (like MBFlagValue)
   - Or document why certain SOAP response fields are not modeled
   - Provide clear mapping between interface types and SOAP XML structure

3. Testing Framework Enhancements:
   - The LibTest framework works well but could benefit from more assertion helpers
   - Consider adding AsrtNotNull, AsrtLength, AsrtContains methods
   - Better error reporting when tests fail (show actual vs expected values)

4. Project Structure:
   - The pattern of Handler -> Hardcode delegation is clear and works well
   - Consider adding External.cs files as placeholders for future external implementations
   - Program.cs test runner could be more generic (auto-discover test classes)

SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPERS
==========================================

1. Copy Pattern from Existing Methods:
   The DoGetDatastoreTypes implementation provided an excellent template. Future
   implementations should follow the same pattern:
   - Handler.cs with try/catch and delegation
   - Hardcode.cs with static data
   - Comprehensive unit tests in both files
   - Update Program.cs to include new tests

2. Use Provided Hardcode Examples:
   The -hardcode.cs files in /doc/per-interface-method/ are valuable. Copy and adapt
   these rather than creating data from scratch. They match the expected response format.

3. Focus on Interface Contract:
   Don't get distracted by SOAP implementation details during hardcode phase. 
   Implement the interface as defined, ensure tests pass, and worry about SOAP
   serialization in external implementation phase.

4. Test Error Scenarios:
   Always include tests for null parameters and exception handling. The LibTest
   framework makes it easy to verify error conditions are handled properly.

5. Keep Tests Simple:
   Tests should verify the contract is met, not implementation details. Focus on:
   - Method returns expected type
   - Error flag is false for success cases
   - Data structure contains expected elements
   - Null inputs don't crash the method

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
==================

The implementation was straightforward thanks to:
- Clear existing patterns in DoGetDatastoreTypes
- Well-structured project architecture
- Good documentation in the prompt files
- Excellent hardcode example data

The code follows project guidelines (brevity, early returns, minimal comments) and
integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. All tests pass and the 
implementation is ready for the next phase (external API integration).

Time to implement: ~30 minutes
Lines of code: ~150 total (including tests)
Test coverage: 6 unit tests covering main scenarios
