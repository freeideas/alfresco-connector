ACTIONABLE ITEMS REPORT - iCustomConnector2 Implementation
===========================================================
Generated: 2025-08-13
Source: Analysis of implementation reports from all 13 methods

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION
==============================================

1. MISSING AiGeneratedConnector.cs FILE [HIGH PRIORITY]
--------------------------------------------------------
Issue: README.md explicitly references AiGeneratedConnector.cs as the "Main partial class 
       implementing iCustomConnector2" but this file does not exist in the project.

Location Referenced:
- /README.md (lines mentioning AiGeneratedConnector.cs in project structure)
- /dist/ folder structure documentation

Reports Mentioning This Issue:
- DoGetServers_hardcode.txt
- DoDescribe_hardcode.txt  
- DoGetWebServices_hardcode.txt
- DoGetGroupsGroups_hardcode.txt

Impact: This is incorrect documentation that will immediately confuse developers trying to 
        understand the project architecture. They will look for a file that doesn't exist.

REQUIRED ACTION: 
- Option A: Create the missing AiGeneratedConnector.cs file that implements iCustomConnector2 
           and delegates to all Handler classes
- Option B: Update README.md to remove all references to AiGeneratedConnector.cs and document 
           the actual architecture being used

Recommendation: Option A is preferred as it would provide a clean integration point and match 
                the intended architecture.


2. PROGRAM.CS HARDCODED TEST LIST [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
----------------------------------------------------
Issue: Program.cs maintains a manually hardcoded list of methods for the "run all tests" 
       functionality. New method implementations must be manually added to this list.

Current State: Tests for new methods won't run with the global test runner unless manually added.

Reports Mentioning This Issue:
- DoGetServers_hardcode.txt
- DoDescribe_hardcode.txt
- Multiple other reports mention test discovery issues

Impact: Developers may think their tests are passing when using "all" option, but their new 
        method tests aren't actually running.

REQUIRED ACTION:
- Implement reflection-based automatic test discovery in Program.cs
- Pattern to discover: All classes in AiGeneratedConnector.Methods.* namespace with RunTests() method
- Remove the hardcoded list and replace with dynamic discovery

Example Implementation:
```csharp
var methodTypes = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
    .GetTypes()
    .Where(t => t.Namespace?.StartsWith("AiGeneratedConnector.Methods") == true 
                && t.Name == "Handler");
```


3. DIST.PY SCRIPT INTEGRATION ISSUE [MEDIUM PRIORITY]
------------------------------------------------------
Issue: The dist/DataConnector.asmx.cs file still contains NotImplementedException for methods 
       instead of properly delegating to the new Handler implementations.

Current State: The distributed package won't actually use any of the implementations.

Impact: Legacy developers integrating the dist package will get NotImplementedException errors 
        when calling the methods.

REQUIRED ACTION:
- Update dist.py script to automatically modify DataConnector.asmx.cs
- Each method should delegate to the corresponding Handler class
- Example: DoGetServers() should call AiGeneratedConnector.Methods.DoGetServers.Handler.DoGetServers()


4. DOCUMENTATION INCONSISTENCIES [LOW PRIORITY]
------------------------------------------------
Issue: Multiple documentation inconsistencies and typos identified.

Specific Issues:
a) DoDescribe JSON has "PrasswordDesc" typo (should be "PasswordDesc")
b) GROUP_ prefix requirement not clearly documented for group IDs
c) Test runner documentation refers to wrong namespace

REQUIRED ACTION:
- Fix typo in /doc/per-interface-method/DoDescribe.json
- Add clear documentation about GROUP_ prefix requirement for group identifiers
- Update test runner documentation to use correct namespace (AiGeneratedConnector not DataConnector)


5. TEST RUNNER NAMESPACE CONFUSION [LOW PRIORITY]
--------------------------------------------------
Issue: Test runner documentation and error messages refer to "DataConnector.Methods" namespace 
       but actual implementation uses "AiGeneratedConnector.Methods" namespace.

Impact: Confusion when running tests, especially for new developers.

REQUIRED ACTION:
- Update all test runner documentation to reflect correct namespace
- Update error messages in unit_test.py script
- Consider adding namespace aliases or better error messages when class not found


ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FROM REPORTS
========================================

1. Parameter Documentation
--------------------------
Multiple reports mention unclear parameter purposes, especially:
- additionalColumns parameter in DoGetUsers/DoGetGroups
- subid and foldersubid in DoItemData  
- typefilters usage in various methods

Action: Create comprehensive parameter documentation explaining purpose and expected values.


2. Error Handling Patterns
---------------------------
Several reports note that error handling is duplicated across all Handler classes.

Action: Consider creating a base Handler class with common error handling logic.


3. Metadata Structure Clarity
------------------------------
DoItemData report mentions confusion about metadata field structure and what goes in 
Hashtable vs direct properties.

Action: Document clear guidelines for metadata field usage with examples.


4. Test Coverage Expansion
--------------------------
Multiple reports suggest adding more edge case testing, especially for:
- Invalid URL handling
- Null parameter combinations
- Empty result sets
- Pagination boundaries

Action: Create a comprehensive test suite template for future methods.


SUMMARY
=======
The most critical issue is the missing AiGeneratedConnector.cs file referenced in README.md.
This should be addressed immediately as it represents incorrect documentation that will 
confuse any developer trying to understand or extend the project.

The second most important issue is fixing the distribution script so that the packaged code 
actually uses the implementations rather than throwing NotImplementedException.

All other issues are quality-of-life improvements that would make the codebase more 
maintainable but don't block functionality.

Total Issues Identified: 5 major + 4 additional recommendations
Estimated effort to fix all issues: 2-3 days of development work
