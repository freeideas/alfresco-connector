# SecuritySyncComplete Method - SOAP Request Processing

## iCustomConnector2 Interface Method
**No corresponding interface method exists** - This is a WSDL-only notification method.

## SOAP Request Handling

### Incoming SOAP Request
The SOAP server receives a `SecuritySyncComplete` action request containing connection parameters and a trace level.

### Special Handling
Since there is no corresponding method in the iCustomConnector2 interface, this request serves as a **notification only**. The server should:
1. Accept the request
2. Ignore the incoming data
3. Return a simple success response

## Parameter Analysis

The SOAP request contains standard connection information that is **not processed**:

### 1. ConnectionInfo (ignored)
**Source**: `<conn>` element in SOAP  
**Fields from actual SOAP**:
- `account`: User account name (e.g., "admin")
- `password`: User password (e.g., "admin")
- `scrubAllData`: Boolean flag (typically true)
- `connectionId`: Integer connection identifier (e.g., 3)
- `sourceSite`: Source site identifier (e.g., "connectors")
- `customparam`: Custom parameter, often a URL (e.g., "http://100.115.192.75:8080/")
- `customparam2`, `customparam3`, `customparam4`: Additional custom parameters (typically empty)
- `customboolparam`, `customboolparam2`, `customboolparam3`, `customboolparam4`: Boolean custom parameters (typically false)
- `BoolParameter`: Collection of BoolPair elements (redundant with direct fields)
- `StringParameter`: Collection of StringPair elements (redundant with direct fields)
- `ChoiceParameter`: Collection of ChoicePair elements (typically empty)

### 2. Trace Level (ignored)
**Source**: `<tl>` element  
**Value**: Trace level string (e.g., "Warning")

## SOAP Server Processing Flow

1. **Receive SOAP Request**: Server receives HTTP POST with `SecuritySyncComplete` SOAP envelope
2. **Validate Structure**: Ensures the SOAP request is well-formed
3. **Skip Processing**: No interface method to call - data is ignored
4. **Return Response**: Returns a standard success response

## Response Structure

The method returns a simple `SecuritySyncCompleteResponse` containing:
```xml
<SecuritySyncCompleteResult>
  <error>false</error>
  <errorMsg />
  <traceInfo />
</SecuritySyncCompleteResult>
```

This matches the `ReturnInterface` type defined in the WSDL.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Purpose**: This method appears to be a notification from the client that security synchronization has completed
2. **No Data Processing**: All incoming parameters should be ignored
3. **Always Succeeds**: Should always return success unless there's a SOAP formatting error
4. **Legacy Compatibility**: Exists in WSDL to maintain compatibility with legacy SOAP clients
5. **Minimal Implementation**: Requires only basic handler with parser and serializer for SOAP envelope handling

## Example SOAP Conversation

From the actual captured traffic:

**Request:**
- SOAPAction: "http://tempuri.org/SecuritySyncComplete"
- Contains standard connection info and trace level
- Sent after security-related operations (GetUsers2, GetGroups2, GetGroupsUsers2, etc.)

## Why This Method Exists

This appears to be a legacy notification mechanism where the SOAP client informs the server that it has completed synchronizing security information. The server doesn't need to take any action - it simply acknowledges receipt of the notification. This pattern is common in older SOAP-based systems where clients would notify servers of state changes even when no server-side processing was required.
